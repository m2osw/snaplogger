* Configuration (proper loading)

* Components (I started on NORMAL/SECURITY, need to make sure it works)

* Thread support (asynchronous logging)

If allowed by the app. (most our app. do not use fork(), but those that
do need to not use threads...) we can create a thread. Whenever log arrives,
we send it to the thread which then formats it and sends it to the various
outputs (file, network, console, syslog...) all the appenders.

Another couple of ideas are to send the logs through a pipe and/or network
but just those appender are not unlikely going to be somewhat slow in
themselves. Plus we'd have to something format the data to send it.
