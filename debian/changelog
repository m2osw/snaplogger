snaplogger (1.0.3.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed the message destructor, I moved the call to logger::log_message() to
    the send_message() function so exceptions work as expected.
  * Fixed the macros (SNAP_LOG_...) so they are compatible with the new scheme.
  * Do not allow empty parameter names.
  * Moved the function_data implementation to the .cpp file.
  * Fixed appender::send_message(), f_enabled must be true.
  * Fixed path to project, this is not libutf8.
  * Moved the list of authors to the AUTHOR.txt file.
  * Simplified headers to only include the basic GPL 2.x reference.
  * Added the ${date:day} variable.
  * Put the empty(), clear(), str() functions in our buffer_appender().
  * By default removed the leading '0' of the `mm` and `dd`.
  * Added a get_appender() by name instead of just type.
  * Added a callback for fatal error reporting before our throw.
  * Updated the existing tests according to the other changes made.
  * Fixed the slow message_severity test, instead of 16 million, run only
    2,700 iterations.
  * Finished up the message tests for 100% coverage.
  * Added the new variable.cpp test for 100% coverage.
